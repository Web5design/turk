Overview
=============

What is Turk?
-------------

Turk is a software framework for interfacing devices and communication protocols
to web applications. It allows hardware creators and web application developers
to work together to make reconfigurable, decoupled user interfaces for
electronics and software. Turk uses an extension of the XMPP protocol to allow
multiple web interfaces to send messages to custom drivers, which then talk to
the hardware or application service. These drivers are run automatically through
the framework, and can be started, stopped, reconfigured, or subscribed to by
many web applications at once. Turk also includes a growing library of optional
services that allow drivers to interface with hardware, web APIs, desktop
applications, and home media.

What Can I Use It For?
----------------------

Turk is an ideal solution for creating a creative web interface to a device that
can be accessed all over the world. Turk is probably not a good solution for
applications that require high-speed communication, military-grade security, or
are highly safety-dependent. However, that still leaves a large number of
potential applications, such as:

* Controlling lighting and sound equipment
* Adding a web interface to an electronic device
* Monitoring sensors and power usage remotely
* Connecting two devices or applications:
    * Control your lights with your clock time
    * Lock the fridge door with your bathroom scale
    * Change lamp color to indicate temperature outside


What Are The Design Goals?
--------------------------

The main goals for for Turk and its future development and features are:

* Simple extendability with drivers and an open API
* Platform independence
* Complete de-coupling of the interface between devices/hardware/protocols and the web
* Making the most common use-cases of the framework the simplest to implement
* Encouraging and simplifying collaboration between developers using different
  programming languages, frameworks and technologies

Since Turk exists to simplify the task of reliably connecting a device or
application to web interfaces, most of these goals can be summarized as follows:
Turk should be simple to learn, use, and extend. Making the framework
over-complicated or difficult to use would mostly defeat the purpose of using
it, after all.
